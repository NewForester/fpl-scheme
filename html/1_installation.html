<p>Scheme is 'small' so 'easy' to learn but not suitable for large applications.</p>
<p>There are many Scheme tutorials on the Internet but this one is for people who do not know how to program.</p>
<p>There are a number of implementation of Scheme available on the Internet but most only run on *nix. MIT-Scheme and one other have installers for Windows. The MIT-Scheme interpreter is comparatively fast.</p>
<p>Only Windows installation is described. For Linux it is assumed you know what you are doing. The on-line instructions were straight forward.</p>
<p>It is claimed that a Scheme program consists of words, parentheses and spaces (indentation). What is being said is that parentheses feature heavily in Scheme programs.</p>
<p>Apart from the parentheses there is little syntax and punctuation characters can appear in the names of functions. Quite what the rules are about what is in a name is not covered.</p>
<p>The contents of the file &quot;$HOMEPATH/scheme.ini&quot; are interpreted when Scheme starts up and so may be used to customise Scheme.</p>
