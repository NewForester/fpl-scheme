# Scheme

## Installing MIT-Scheme

Scheme is 'small' so 'easy' to learn but not suitable for large applications.

There are many Scheme tutorials on the Internet but this one is for people who do not know how to program.

There are a number of implementation of Scheme available on the Internet but most only run on *nix.
MIT-Scheme and one other have installers for Windows.
The MIT-Scheme interpreter is comparatively fast.

Only Windows installation is described.
For Linux it is assumed you know what you are doing.
The on-line instructions were straight forward.

It is claimed that a Scheme program consists of words, parentheses and spaces (indentation).
What is being said is that parentheses feature heavily in Scheme programs.

Apart from the parentheses there is little syntax and punctuation characters can appear in the names of functions.
Quite what the rules are about what is in a name is not covered.

The contents of the file "$HOMEPATH/scheme.ini" are interpreted when Scheme starts up and so may be used to customise Scheme.
