# FPL Scheme

This repository contains:

  * notes made while studying [Yet Another Scheme Tutorial](http://www.shido.info/lisp/idx_scm_e.html);
  * exercises and examples from the tutorial;
  * any other Scheme notes, exercises and examples of my own devising.

The study was done as part of an investigation into Functional Programming Languages with a view to answering the questions:

  * what is all the fuss about ?
  * do any offer any advantages over APL or Python for that matter

The notes and exercises are not a management investigation into why an organisation should use Scheme
but a technical investigation into what you would need to understand in order to begin programming in Scheme.

While the material here is my own, it owes a great deal to the tutorial, which was written by [SHIDO, Takafumi](http://www.shido.info/index_e.html).
